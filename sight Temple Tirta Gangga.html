                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Temple Tirta Gangga is an architectural complex built in Bali by King Karangasem in the mid-twentieth century. It is located in the eastern part of the island, 70 kilometers from Denpasar. The area of the water palace is approximately 1.3 hectares. </p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">The name of the palace is made up of two words: Tirta - which can be translated as "sacred water" - and Gangga, which corresponds to the name of the sacred river Ganges in India. According to legends, this river used to flow in the heavens, but then was brought down to earth with the help of the god Shiva. Thus, the name of the palace can be translated as "sacred waters of the river Ganges.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">The water palace is an architectural ensemble with elements of Balinese and Chinese design. It looks like a bizarre maze of ponds, fountains, bridges and alleys with dozens of statues of animals and demons, traditional for the local culture. The entire composition of the palace is framed in a lush green garden.</p>
