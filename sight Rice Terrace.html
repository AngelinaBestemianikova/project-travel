                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Bali's rice plantations are not just flat fields. Since ancient times, rice has been grown on steps right on the hillsides on the island. This unique irrigation system is called Subak. The unusual rice plantations resemble giant stairs. Some of the terraces are more than 1,000 years old.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">If you are on the terraces at the very beginning of the rice growing season after the shoots are planted in the ground and flooded with water, you can see an amazing sight - hundreds of water mirrors as if they are descending the hillsides, reflecting the sky. Many tourists, photographers, and nature lovers seek to take a moment to get to the terraces at this time.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">There are several terraces in Bali. The largest and most interesting are Tegallalang and Jatiluvih. Tegallalang Rice Terraces are located near Ubud, on the hills 800 meters above sea level.  Almost in the heart of the island of Bali at the foot of Mount Batukaru over 300 hectares of rice terraces Jatiluvih. Everyone who comes across these unusual rice paddies takes their breath away. That's why in 2012 UNESCO recognized these terraces and the irrigation system in Bali as a World Heritage Site.</p>
