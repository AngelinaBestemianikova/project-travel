                <p class="recommended-sights__text">The temple of Ulun Danu is located in the central part of Bali, on the western side of Lake Bratan. It is the second most important temple on the island after Pura Besakih. This temple has sacred significance to the indigenous inhabitants of Bali. It was founded in 1663.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">The temple was consecrated in honor of Devi Danu, the Hindu goddess who commands the element of water. Ulun Danu translates as "head of the lake". The Balinese have always developed a cult of water. Locals used to bring generous gifts to the goddess and ask for a rich harvest in return.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Travelers fortunate enough to be near the temple are unanimous in saying that the views leave a strong impression. The water comes very close to the shrine, making it seem as if Pura Ulun Danu is floating on the lake surface. The scenery is enhanced by the mountains, which form a picturesque backdrop to the temple.</p>
