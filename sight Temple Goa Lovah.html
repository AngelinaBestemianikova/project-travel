                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Pura Goa Lawah is one of the most mysterious temples on the entire island. It was built at the entrance to a cave labyrinth, which is home to thousands of bats. It is for this feature that it got its name.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">There is an interesting legend, according to which, in addition to bats, there are giant snakes - Nags - living in the cave. They are mythical creatures with a human torso and head, but with a serpent's tail. They guard countless treasures located in the labyrinths. In the early twentieth century, Dutch soldiers wanted to take over the temple by force and loot it. The Balinese claim that Nags saved the temple from such a treacherous act by turning the strangers to flight.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">The religious ceremonies held on the temple grounds are very impressive. Brahmans chant mantras, praying locals come to the temple with gifts and are sure to wear brightly colored festive robes. Against the eerie beauty of the cave, the motley crowd of Balinese seems like some unreal vision.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Despite the solid age of the temple, its territory looks very good. Seeing all this, it is difficult to believe that the temple is already about 1000 years old.</p>
