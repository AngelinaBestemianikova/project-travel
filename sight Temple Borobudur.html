                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Borobudur is a solid jewel in the province of Central Java. This temple complex is considered to be the oldest among the Buddhist shrines. The colossal size of the structure is not worth mentioning at all!  The temple is recognized as an example of Indonesian medieval architecture and therefore since 1991 is included in the list of World Heritage Sites.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Borobudur rises in one of the most picturesque regions of Java - the sacred valley Kebu - 40 km from Yogyakarta. For a long time Borobudur was hidden under the volcanic ash among the dense jungles of Java and has seen the light again only at the beginning of the XIX century. Now the Buddhist "stone lotus" is one of the most popular attractions in Indonesia.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">There is a beautiful legend that Java floated in the ocean waters and until it was "pinned" with a rod to the center of the earth, people could not live peacefully on it. This rod, its top, is covered by Tidar hill and was located in the very place where Borobudur was erected.</p>
