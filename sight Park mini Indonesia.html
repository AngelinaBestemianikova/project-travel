                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Indonesia Park in Miniature is a cultural and entertainment area located in East Jakarta. The park covers a large area - about 250 acres. Visitors can learn a lot about Indonesia and its inhabitants, to see the country in miniature, hence the name of the park.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">There are pavilion-museums built in the park, whose exhibits reflect all aspects of daily life in 26 provinces of Indonesia (that was the number of provinces in 1975, today there are 34). These pavilions display pieces of Indonesian architecture, national costumes, and sometimes even a theatrical show featuring national costumes and national dances.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Not far from these pavilions is a lake with artificial islands in the middle, which are a visual mini-model of the largest archipelago in the world Indonesia. Today on the territory of the park you can visit not  only the museums, but also a water park.</p>
