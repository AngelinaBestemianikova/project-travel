                <p class="recommended-sights__text">The complex of seven waterfalls Sekumpul is located in the north of Bali. The waterfall is considered the tallest and one of the most beautiful on the island. The water falls from a height of 80 meters. The road to the waterfalls goes among the jungle, past local farms and rice terraces. Along the way, there are observation decks that offer a view of the waterfalls.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Sekumpul Waterfall has been open to visitors since 2010. Of the seven waterfalls of the complex are available only two. They are located in the middle of the picturesque jungle. It is always cool and humid near the waterfall.  In sunny weather, the rays and splashes form numerous rainbows, it is a very beautiful sight. The path to the waterfall goes along the abyss, overgrown with tropical vegetation. Along the path there are relict coconut ferns, rambutan and durian trees.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Sekumpul Falls is a great experience for those who want to enjoy unspoiled nature. When you come here, you feel like you are in a lost world, as if millions of years of evolution have bypassed this place. </p>
