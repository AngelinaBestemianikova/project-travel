                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Tanah Lot is an unusual temple in Bali, standing on a tiny rocky island. According to legend, Tanah Lot was founded in the 16th century by a Javanese priest, Nirartha, who dedicated it to the sea deity. It is one of the island's sacred temples and is protected by the world organization UNESCO.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Tanah Lot can be visited only at low tide. And when the waves approach the island, the small beach separating the temple from the village is completely flooded. It is probably because of this feature that Tanah Lot became known as the temple on the water. It is believed that the sea is the abode of demons and evil spirits, and the temples are meant to protect Balinese from them. At Tanah Lot, sea gods are worshipped, the chief of which is Bharara Segara, who represents the power of the ocean.</p>
                <p class="recommended-sights__text">Before entering the temple, worshippers must undergo a symbolic rite of purification - to perform a prayer and drink water from the holy spring. For a small donation, tourists can also undergo this rite, but tourists do not have access to the altars.</p>
