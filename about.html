            <p class="about-section__text-without-image">Indonesia is a country of contrasts; a place where you can find the concrete jungle of large modern cities and remote villages of primitive tribes, impenetrable rainforests and comfortable beaches with luxurious hotels. It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. It is located in Southeast Asia on both sides of the equator. Indonesia is called the "Land of a Thousand Islands", wanting to emphasize that this is the largest island state in the world. The main tourist trump cards of the country are its distinctive culture, unspoiled nature, unique flora and fauna, unlimited opportunities for water sports at any time of the year.</p>

                    <p class="about-section__text">Indonesia is one of the last places on the planet where you can get in touch with nature as it was thousands of years ago. </p>
                    <p class="about-section__text">The islands of Sumatra and Borneo remained the last refuge of the Malay bear. Only Sumatra is home to the black gibbon. In the east are echidnas, anteaters and tree kangaroos. Komodo Island is the home of the famous komodo  dragon, which lives only here. Indonesia is the only country where the orangutan survives. If you are lucky, you can see the rhinoceros bird, peacock, paradise-bird.</p>
